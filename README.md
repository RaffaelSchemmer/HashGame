## üßø About the Application Purpose
<div align="justify">
  In this GitHub repository, you will find a <b>simple hash game</b>. This application/game was developed :bulb:, to the CETEC 2019 A2 classroom to understand the concepts related to matrix #Ô∏è‚É£ data structure, procedures, functions and a visual graphic GRID structure (StringGRID). </div>

## :rocket: About the Application Architecture and Technologies
<div align="justify">
The [Specification of problem!](https://www.github.com/RaffaelSchemmer/A2/blob/master/%5BEspecifica%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20dos%20Trabalhos%5D/%5BXXII%5D%20Jogo%20do%20Genio.pdf)
(made by the teacher) ask that students developing a hash game delphi application, using a VCL StringGRID component and a set of functions to implement the logic of application. In a hash game, you need some funcitons to find a ideal position to play (that avoid computer to lost the game, if exists this posibility) and to try to gain the game (considering some pattern existing in the game)
</div>

## ‚úÖ Requirements to Installing the Application
<div align="justify">
Just execute (EXE) file in bin folder. This application only running in Windows machines.
</div>

## üíª Requirements to Running the Application
- Computer with Windows Xp or Later

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Community and Contributions to Future Work
<div align="justify">
Our major dreaming of this project, is that our students understands the concept related to matrix data structure, procedures, functions and a visual GRID structure (StringGRID). But, we are open to new ideas to grow this project to the next level. With future work, that you can implement, we suggest a desktop version of Delphi, where user can define the difficult of game, by changing the complexity of computer algorithm.
